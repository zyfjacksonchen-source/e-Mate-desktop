# Visual Styles — Index

A **visual style** is how the deck **looks** — shape language, decoration density, whitespace rhythm, typographic character, texture / elevation. Resolve **one per deck**; Default locks it, while Quick keeps it only in active context. It anchors the aesthetic of the SVG layout itself (cards, dividers, spacing, corner radius, shadow use).

**Hard rule — capability boundary**: A style governs treatment, visual weight,
density, recurrence, and coherence. It never decides carrier eligibility or
image source, and never narrows the complete primitive, Office-preset,
independent-composition, Boolean, or necessary-freeform authoring vocabulary.
Page purpose selects the carriers and construction; the style makes the chosen
forms belong to one visual system.

> **Styles carry NO fixed HEX and define no palette.** Default core color identity and recurring role behavior live in `design_spec.colors` / `spec_lock.colors` (confirmation `e`); Quick resolves equivalent palette anchors in active context. A visual style describes how those anchors behave in SVG composition and may call for contextual tints, gradients, effects, or material transitions; it does not substitute an unrelated palette. Generated images follow the same anchor model through [`image-renderings/`](../image-renderings/). [`image-palettes/`](../image-palettes/) is legacy compatibility material only.
>
> A visual style is *not* a mode. **Visual style = how it looks; mode = how you argue** (see [`modes/_index.md`](../modes/_index.md)). Resolve them independently — any style pairs with any mode.

## 1. Catalog

Each style keeps its own authoritative file with: shape & decoration, typography character, color-usage discipline (no HEX), texture / elevation, and the paired image-rendering. Read this index alone while choosing a direction. Only after a preset or custom bases are fixed may the active role read the selected sibling files: one file for a preset, every exact `visual_style_references` file for a catalog-based custom, and none for a novel custom. Never glob the directory or read an unselected sibling. The catalog mirrors [`image-renderings`](../image-renderings/_index.md): each style's "Paired rendering" names the illustration family that shares its aesthetic.

> The **`visual_style` value is only ever a first-column `id`** (`swiss-minimal`, `editorial`, …). The "Paired rendering" column lists **image-rendering** names (`flat`, `minimalist-swiss`, `digital-dashboard`, …) — never treat one of those as the `visual_style`. Default records rendering under confirmation h; Quick keeps the selected rendering only in active context and any required image manifest.
>
> The **`Illus.`** column describes illustration's role only after the resource-need review selects illustration — `core` (illustration may lead the look), `supportive` (illustration may share the composition), or `sparse` (illustration stays selective so the style's lead visual remains clear). It tunes selected illustration's centrality and recurrence; it never recommends adding illustration, selects an AI source or image row, or narrows eligible page types, element scale, or carrier combinations. An explicit user request to use / skip illustrations overrides it either way, and `image_usage: none` always writes no illustration rows. Full per-style rule in each file's §6.

## 2. Selection Boundary

**Reference — not a constraint**: Resolve the audience task, outcome, delivery
context, required carriers, and artifact afterlife before choosing. Compare the
complete catalog's character, composition language, density, typography, and
texture with the project as a whole. A topic, industry, or style keyword never
selects a row; the same subject may support different visual systems when its
communication job changes.

| Decision dimension | Evidence to compare |
|---|---|
| Shape and space | Contour language, grid behavior, whitespace, and boundary strength |
| Information texture | Sparse presence, editorial hierarchy, dense evidence, or hand-made expression |
| Carrier integration | How the system accommodates the page's actual photos, illustrations, charts, tables, and native geometry |
| Typography character | The role editable type plays inside the composition, independent of exact font choice |
| Delivery and afterlife | Viewing distance, projection/print behavior, reuse, and expected editing |

**Default — derive shape language from project fit (may override when a generic
primitive system is itself the clearest identity or communication choice)**:
Before settling on lines, rectangles, circles, or ellipses as the deck's main
shape language, test whether the source material, identity, or communication
job offers a more specific edge, corner, opening, angle, contour, or layering
logic. Retain a primitive-led result when it deliberately fits; do not select
an exact authoring preset here.

> When the deck has AI images, the "Paired rendering" column exposes an
> aesthetically related option. It does not select the rendering or create an
> AI image job; compare it with the actual image roles before using it.
>
> Not every image-rendering becomes its own visual style. A rendering earns a layout twin only when it defines a whole-page layout language (shape, whitespace, composition, texture) — not merely how an inserted image looks. Purely atmospheric renderings (`nature`, `warm-scene`, `fantasy-animation`) stay imagery-only: they pair with whichever layout style fits rather than being one. (Note the distinction `photo-editorial` draws: photography as a *rendering* is image-look, but photo-*led composition* is a real layout language — so the style exists, paired with `corporate-photo`.)

## 3. Editable `custom` projection

Each Default Stage-2 direction authors one visible, non-empty `custom` aesthetic under [`strategist.md`](../strategist.md) §d — its executable shape language, composition geometry, decoration density, whitespace, typography character, and texture — naming only the catalog bases it actually uses. Quick resolves one preset or custom behavior under [`quick-generate.md`](../../workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md) §2 and persists nothing.

---

## 4. How to use

**Resolution scope**: deck-wide (one style per deck); Executor reads the confirmed preset file or exact custom references. It anchors taste as a
**reference**, not a whitelist. Each §1 `Composition geometry` list is
generative vocabulary, not a finite layout menu; pages may synthesize or
deviate when their communication job calls for it.
