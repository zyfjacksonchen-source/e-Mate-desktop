# Google Brand Specification

> Identity-only preset. No SVG page roster — pages are composed freely under these constraints.

## I. Brand Overview

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Brand Name | Google |
| Use Cases | Product launches, developer events (Google I/O style), corporate updates, multi-product decks, ecosystem education / training |
| Tone | Modern, friendly, optimistic, clear, multi-color expressive |
| Sources | Bundled Google SVG assets; [Google Brand Resource Center](https://about.google/brand-resource-center/guidance/), reviewed 2026-07-13 |

## II. Color Scheme

| Role | HEX | Provenance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| primary | `#4285F4` | fact | Google Blue — extracted from `google_g_logo.svg` |
| secondary | `#34A853` | fact | Google Green |
| accent (warm) | `#FBBC05` | fact | Google Yellow |
| accent (alert) | `#EA4335` | fact | Google Red |
| text | `#202124` | approx | Standard Material / Google product UI text |
| bg | `#FFFFFF` | approx | Default light presentation background |

The four primary brand colors (Blue / Green / Yellow / Red) carry equal weight in Google brand usage; the `primary` / `secondary` / `accent` role split above is a slide-layout presentation hierarchy convention, not a brand prominence statement. Strategist may rotate any of the four into the dominant role per page rhythm.

## III. Typography

| Role | Family | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| title | `"Segoe UI", "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` | 500–700 |
| body | `"Segoe UI", "Microsoft YaHei", sans-serif` | 400 |

> `Google Sans` and `Roboto` are references. PPT Master neither auto-embeds fonts nor follows CSS tails in PowerPoint. The rows above are the default Windows/Office export; replace them only with a user-confirmed target-installed face.

## IV. Logo

Google uses a dual-lockup brand system — pick by context, never combine on the same page.

| File | Form | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `../images/google_wordmark.svg` | Full "Google" wordmark (272×92) | Cover hero, ending sign-off, any moment the full brand reads at a glance |
| `../images/google_g_logo.svg` | Square multi-color "G" mark (24×24) | Header / footer corners, page-number neighbors, tight badges, any small-size moment where the wordmark would become illegible |

- Cover: prefer wordmark
- Per-page: optional — only when wordmark or G mark genuinely fits the layout; do not stamp every page
- Use only unmodified approved artwork and follow the official guidance for the actual context; never imply affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement
- Clearspace: follow the applicable official asset guidance; never crowd the logo or place it on a busy background

## V. Voice & Tone

- Formality: neutral
- Person: we / you (English), 我们 / 你 (Chinese)
- Emoji: allowed
- Abbreviations: common-abbrev-allowed

## VI. Icon Style

- Preference: one consistent Material-aligned family; filled or stroke according to the deck context

> This is a presentation convention, not permission to imitate Google's visual identity. When the deck uses `templates/icons/`, choose one compatible family and keep weight/fill treatment consistent.
