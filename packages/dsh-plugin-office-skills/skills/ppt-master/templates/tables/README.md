# Table Visualization Templates

This directory contains six canonical cell-grid references. A table belongs
here only when a row header and column header jointly address each body fact;
headers, cells, rectangular merges, alignment, and boundaries preserve that
intersection model. Numeric values inside cells do not by themselves turn the
grid into a chart.

Value-driven mark geometry belongs in [`charts/`](../charts/). Qualitative page
topology is built as a page-specific Structure by Executor. Reusable PowerPoint
Master/Layout systems belong in [`layouts/`](../layouts/).

## Source of truth

[`tables_index.json`](./tables_index.json) is the machine registry. Its
`tables` object maps each canonical key to one diagnostic-recall `summary`;
keys match `<key>.svg`, and `meta.total` matches the canonical SVG roster.
[`table-vocabulary.md`](./table-vocabulary.md) projects the same six keys as
objective planning-side information relationships without execution details or
selection conclusions.

Default Strategist and Quick read the complete Table vocabulary together with
the Chart vocabulary before planning. They compare every objective
relationship, then use
[`visualization_recall.py`](../../scripts/visualization_recall.py) `validate`
to resolve selected canonical references. Its `recall` mode remains an optional
diagnostic helper over the machine registry, not the runtime capability gate.
Default writes
`table/<key>` to `page_visualizations`; Quick keeps the selected reference in
active context.

## Authoring contract

[`VISUALIZATION_TEMPLATE_AUTHORING.md`](../VISUALIZATION_TEMPLATE_AUTHORING.md)
owns the shared standalone-SVG, neutral-preview, root-boundary, Shape-first,
family, and catalog rules. Table-specific requirements are:

- Preserve the complete row/column topology, headers, values, units, ordering,
  merges, alignment, totals, status, and source notes.
- Default output remains independently editable DrawingML shapes.
- Add native Table replacement metadata to every supported pure text grid; it
  is native-ready by default. The fallback and metadata contain the same cells.
- Keep graphical cells such as rating dots, icons, status marks, avatars, or
  embedded bars on the Shape fallback route unless the active native-data
  contract explicitly supports them.

| Canonical key | Grid contract |
|---|---|
| `record_table` | One flat record per row and one stable heterogeneous field per column |
| `metric_table` | Operating metrics by entity with current values, changes, statuses, or target progress inside cells |
| `comparison_matrix` | Criteria × alternatives with exact, prose, or heterogeneous facts at intersections |
| `feature_matrix` | Capabilities × offerings with supported, unsupported, partial, or exception states |
| `rating_matrix` | Criteria × alternatives using one repeated ordinal scale |
| `hierarchical_table` | Grouped or indented rows with detail and subtotal/total hierarchy |

**Hard rule — physical table is not semantic Table**: A PowerPoint table used
as a drawing grid does not enter this family automatically. Exact dates or
durations that drive horizontal task positions and lengths belong to
`chart/gantt_chart`; qualitative stage/lane placement belongs to
a page-specific Structure.

Selecting a table reference does not itself select native output. Design Spec
§IX/Quick names independent objects separately and decides
`<object-key>=yes|no`; explicit `--native-charts-and-tables` export is a second
opt-in.
