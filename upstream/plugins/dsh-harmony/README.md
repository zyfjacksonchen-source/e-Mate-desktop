## Usage

Just type *"What about we use dsh-harmony"* when vibe coding your DSH plugin.

## Introduction

Use Harmony when one DeepSeek Harness plugin needs to change another without maintaining a fork. Harmony loads Patches before the target runs, changes its compiled code in memory, and starts Harness with the result.

Source Patches find TypeScript AST nodes with TSQuery and rewrite their source ranges with MagicString. They run one after another, each reading the source left by the previous Patch. This lets several plugins change the same target while leaving installed files untouched.

A provider can place its Patches before or after another provider. One Patch may override that rule, and users may interleave Patches from different providers. When several changes must succeed together, a composite Patch gives them one position and one switch; if a member fails, Harmony applies none of them.

For browser plugins, Harmony also keeps provider-owned `<style data-plugin>` tags in Patch order. A provider owns one style group, so its last enabled Patch decides where that group appears in the CSS cascade. Harmony repeats the ordering after a Patch reload.

Harmony binds each new session to the ordered enabled Patch profile that created it, including provider versions and Patch-content fingerprints. The shared DSH data root stores these bindings in `harmony-sessions.json`, leaving DSH session artifacts unchanged. Before Web loads a tracked session, Harmony compares that binding with the current profile; a mismatch shows the missing, added, changed, or reordered Patches and lets you return without loading the session.

Harmony also records the last ordered Patch profile that started the shared DSH instance in `$DSH_HOME/harmony-instance.json`. Every startup compares its current profile with that data-side record. A mismatch is logged and shown in Web before the record advances to the running configuration, so a profile switch or Patch change is visible once at the point it starts touching the shared sessions, attachments, workspace metadata, and other storage under the same DSH home.

Harmony adds modification to the ways DeepSeek Harness plugins can work together.

## Why Harmony

Ordinary DSH extension points remain the first choice when the target exposes the behavior you need. Harmony is for the gap between those APIs and maintaining a fork: changing an internal component, loader entry, or compiled behavior that the target does not expose.

| Without Harmony | With Harmony |
| --- | --- |
| Hide or duplicate an internal UI and keep both implementations aligned | Replace the selected component or compiled call site in place |
| Patch `node_modules`, carry a fork, or reapply edits after upgrades | Transform source in memory; installed package files remain byte-for-byte unchanged |
| Discover a selector drift only after the UI silently breaks | Pin package version and `expect`; version drift warns while a real match failure fails visibly in `status` |
| Treat the final bundle as a black box | Inspect the original, every Patch step, and the final transformed source |
| Remove custom edits manually | Disable or remove the Provider to restore the original behavior |

Harmony does not turn compiled internals into a stable public API. It makes that dependency explicit, ordered, inspectable, and reversible.

## Install

Requires Node.js `^22.15.0` or `>=23.5.0` and a current `@deepseek-ai/dsh` installation. The built-in DSH integrations are verified for `0.1.1-rc.2` and `0.1.2-alpha.4`; their compatibility lanes are bounded independently so older selectors are not widened across the `0.1.2` internal refactors. Harmony does not gate DSH versions during installation; Patch target ranges are advisory and Harmony still attempts each Patch against newer releases with visible drift warnings and exact-match checks.

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2
npm install -g dsh-harmony
dsh web
```

Open **Settings → Harmony** after starting the WebUI. For profiles, Desktop integration, updates, and removal, see the [installation guide](https://memorax-ai.github.io/dsh-harmony/guide/installation).

**Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Harmony → Multithreaded loading** controls parallel Patch preflight. It defaults to `1`, which preserves the original single-threaded execution model. Higher values run independent Source Patch file components in worker threads; every Patch touching the same file, and every cross-file composite Patch, remains ordered in one component. Semantic Patch components stay on the main thread. Worker callbacks have isolated module and global state, and each worker adds memory overhead.

Use the terminal UI or non-interactive commands against any profile. Commands contact a running Host transactionally and report `live`; stopped profiles are validated and updated atomically as `offline`.

Multiple Hosts may use the same profile. Harmony follows DSH Settings' write model: whole-profile writes are serialized by a file lock and committed atomically; a stale UI save is rejected and refreshed, while concurrent processes use last-complete-write-wins semantics.

```sh
dsh harmony --profile web
dsh harmony status --json --profile web
dsh harmony disable my-provider/optional-patch --profile web
dsh harmony enable-provider my-provider --profile web
dsh harmony patch-order show --profile web
dsh harmony patch-order move my-provider/optional-patch --before other-provider/base --profile web
dsh harmony patch-order auto --profile web
dsh harmony provider-order move my-provider --after base-provider --profile web
dsh harmony inspect target-package --patch my-provider/optional-patch --summary --profile web
dsh harmony reload my-provider --profile web
```

Press `Tab` in the TUI to switch between Provider and Patch views. The Patch view supports individual and Provider-wide enablement, Patch ordering, automatic sorting, runtime details, and concise inspection. Both views keep the selection visible when a profile is larger than the terminal.

`status`, `patch-order show`, and `provider-order show` exit with status `1` when their health or order constraints fail. `patch-order auto` and `provider-order auto` minimize violations while preserving the current order where possible. `inspect --summary` omits transformed source, while `--patch <key>` limits inspection to targets touched by one Patch. `reload` requires a running Host.

## Patch model

Harmony runs every Patch from one global `patchOrder`. Provider-level `before` and `after` rules set the usual order. A Patch that declares either rule uses its own rules instead. In **Settings → Harmony**, users can move a whole provider or place one Patch between Patches from another provider. Plugin and Patch details provide their enable and disable actions, while the Patch status page is a read-only runtime monitor. Harmony checks that the saved list contains every registered Patch exactly once.

Plugin-wide disablement is an independent `provider/*` flag. It never clears or creates individual Patch flags. Re-enabling a plugin therefore restores only the Patches that were individually enabled before the plugin was disabled.

Every Patch may declare a human-readable `description`. Harmony exposes it through Patch status and JSON output, and displays it in Settings so users can understand the Patch before changing its order or enablement.

A composite Patch groups several Patches under one order position and switch. Members keep their declared order and apply only when every member succeeds. A failed standalone Patch is reported and skipped; later Patches and the Host continue to run.

## Plugin compatibility

Any DSH plugin package can describe its relationships with other plugins under `dsh.plugin.compatibility`, whether or not it provides Harmony Patches:

```json
{
  "dsh": {
    "plugin": {
      "compatibility": {
        "requires": {
          "base-plugin": "^2.0.0"
        },
        "conflicts": {
          "legacy-plugin": "*"
        },
        "integrates": {
          "optional-renderer": "^1.0.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`requires` reports a missing, inactive, or incompatible dependency; `conflicts` warns when an incompatible pair is active; and `integrates` reports an available optional integration. These declarations never install, enable, disable, or block plugins. Targets are package names and values are semver ranges. Reciprocal conflict declarations produce one warning, and disabling a Harmony Patch does not disable its owning plugin.

When a plugin must activate another Harmony Provider's bundle, declare it under `dsh.harmony.requires`. Harmony resolves it from the requiring package, adds its bundle as a temporary startup layer, and reuses an already configured bundle instead of creating a duplicate Loader entry. The dependency must still be installed by the package manager.

```json
{
  "dsh": {
    "harmony": {
      "requires": {
        "the-binding-of-dsh": ">=0.1.3 <0.2.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Live reports use the plugins active in Loader. When the profile is stopped, Harmony can only inspect its installation and therefore treats installed profile packages as active.

## Load coordination

Harmony indexes the final transformed module graph as part of each Patch generation. Browser module ordering follows imports and `require()` calls introduced by Patches, while Host reload follows the module edges actually resolved by Node.js and reloads affected dependents in the same transaction.

Plugins that already inject the Harmony service can inspect the current generation without controlling Loader lifecycle themselves:

```ts
export const inject = ['harmony']

export function apply(ctx) {
  const plan = ctx.harmony.loadPlan()
  // packages, Patch targets, transformed modules, and observed Loader entries
}
```

`loadPlan()` is diagnostic data for the committed generation. Static `inject` and `provide` findings describe possible module relationships; observed Entry records contain the exact runtime metadata reported by Cordis. Cordis Fiber state remains authoritative for actual activation.

Provider discovery currently follows the composed profile package graph. Consequently, a Provider Entry disabled by Loader configuration, including a truthy `disabled: !!js ...` expression, may still contribute its Harmony Patches. Use Harmony's Provider or Patch switches when Patch activation must follow an explicit runtime setting.

## React-aware patches

Install `dsh-harmony-react` in a Patch provider when the target is compiled React:

```sh
npm install dsh-harmony-react
```

Use `element()` to change selected compiled `jsx` / `jsxs` calls. Use `component()` to change the shared component definition. Harmony applies both in the same Patch order as every other Source Patch.

| API | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `element()` | One or more selected call sites: replace, wrap, insert, transform props, or remove |
| `component()` | Every call through an initialized variable or named function declaration: decorate or replace |

To let later Component Patches modify the same definition, Harmony rewrites a function declaration as an initialized `const`. The new binding is not hoisted. If the file reads the component before its declaration, use a core Source Patch instead. [React integration](https://memorax-ai.github.io/dsh-harmony/integrations/react) covers selectors, Inspect traces, and Studio.

## Development

All maintained implementation code uses TypeScript. Build artifacts are generated for packaging and are not tracked by Git.

Documentation sources and local preview tooling live on the [`docs`](https://github.com/memorax-ai/dsh-harmony/tree/docs) branch.

```sh
npm test
```

Set `DSH_HARMONY_PERF=1` when starting DSH to log one structured timing record for each Harmony startup, plugin update, profile update, and manual reload:

```sh
DSH_HARMONY_PERF=1 dsh web --no-open
```

Each record separates Patch preparation, source transformation, Host reload, browser rebuild, and total time. The probe stays inactive by default. Node.js diagnostic tools can instead subscribe to the `diagnostics_channel` channel `dsh-harmony:load` without enabling log output.
