# Vision Toolkit requirements traceability

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

This reference maps the DSH Vision Toolkit product brief's committed P0/P1 requirements to their owning implementation, automated coverage, and runnable acceptance evidence. A row marked **Delivered** is part of the package contract; P2/P3 rows document intentional product boundaries rather than unfinished P0/P1 work.

## Cross-cutting requirements

| Area | Contract and evidence |
|---|---|
| Security | [`src/paths.ts`](../../src/paths.ts) confines reads and writes by realpath; [`src/runtime.ts`](../../src/runtime.ts) decodes and limits images before upload and structurally parses trace SVG before commit; [`src/upstream.ts`](../../src/upstream.ts) marks image text/instructions as untrusted in every direct and long-OCR visual-model prompt; [`src/tools.ts`](../../src/tools.ts) and [`src/skill.ts`](../../src/skill.ts) tell the text agent to treat derived output as evidence, not commands; [`src/artifact-access.ts`](../../src/artifact-access.ts) revalidates signed files on every read and sandboxes SVG; [`src/errors.ts`](../../src/errors.ts) redacts secrets. Path, symlink, format, size, XML/doctype, prompt guard, token-forgery, file-replacement, and CSP cases are automated. |
| Portability | Runtime and browser calls use argv vectors and Node filesystem/process APIs rather than POSIX shell composition. Managed preparation has `uv` and `venv`/pip paths; Python and Chrome discovery include platform-specific candidates. Package tests avoid machine-local dependency specifiers, and the checked-in fixture/profile flow is keyless. |
| Performance and cancellation | [`src/runtime.ts`](../../src/runtime.ts) applies one hard deadline, propagates `AbortSignal`, bounds per-session concurrency, rejects oversized decoded images before remote I/O, deduplicates repeated inputs within one glance operation, and keeps a one-entry content/configuration-keyed cache for the last successful identical glance in each live Session. [`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts) aborts plugin-owned calls before unregistering tools. Timeout, caller/plugin cancellation, cache-hit/miss, semaphore, and independent-session behavior are automated. |
| Observability | [`src/runtime.ts`](../../src/runtime.ts) logs bounded tool name, outcome, total/upstream duration, image count/bytes/pixels, cache hits, model, and error category while excluding base64, credentials, headers, and unbounded upstream output. |
| Model-context economy | The profile-global runtime publishes one small bootstrap, while [`src/exposure.ts`](../../src/exposure.ts) mounts the ten execution schemas only in an Agent that loads `vision-tools` and hides the bootstrap afterward. Other Agents remain unchanged. Health, connection, and version diagnostics stay exclusively on the Web Settings seam and never become model tools. Unit tests cover Agent isolation and restoration; every real-profile tool flow asserts the initial and activated schema sets. |
| Maintainability | Every tool calls one [`VisionToolkitRuntime`](../../src/runtime.ts); DSH-specific adaptation remains in [`src/tools.ts`](../../src/tools.ts), [`src/exposure.ts`](../../src/exposure.ts), [`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts), [`src/web.ts`](../../src/web.ts), and [`src/client/index.tsx`](../../src/client/index.tsx), while the pinned upstream remains the sole algorithm source. Runtime readiness, Skill/bootstrap publication, and Agent-scoped schemas belong to one lifecycle generation. |
| HTML screenshot isolation | The pinned screenshot guard uses a disposable Chrome profile, `--use-mock-keychain`, and `--incognito`, removes the profile after each call, and keeps network disabled. [`tests/html-screenshot-guard.spec.ts`](../../tests/html-screenshot-guard.spec.ts) captures the actual argv and cleanup behavior. |
| UI restoration acceptance | [`scripts/ui-restoration-example.ts`](../../scripts/ui-restoration-example.ts) performs reference → HTML render → pixel diff through the real runtime. [`examples/ui-restoration/README.md`](../../examples/ui-restoration/README.md) owns the reproducible procedure and checked-in evidence; [`tests/ui-restoration-example.spec.ts`](../../tests/ui-restoration-example.spec.ts) enforces it. |

## Error and lifecycle scenarios

| Scenario | Expected behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Missing/invalid image, format, region, or path | Reject before upstream execution with an input, capacity, or path-safe error | [`tests/paths.spec.ts`](../../tests/paths.spec.ts), [`tests/runtime.spec.ts`](../../tests/runtime.spec.ts) |
| Missing Credential | Local tools remain usable; remote tools and explicit connection tests report a redacted configuration/service action | [`tests/runtime.spec.ts`](../../tests/runtime.spec.ts), [`tests/web.spec.ts`](../../tests/web.spec.ts) |
| 401/403, 429, timeout, malformed output, or cancellation | Return a stable actionable category, preserve bounded diagnostics, and stop the request/subprocess | [`tests/errors.spec.ts`](../../tests/errors.spec.ts), [`tests/runtime.spec.ts`](../../tests/runtime.spec.ts), [`tests/upstream.spec.ts`](../../tests/upstream.spec.ts) |
| Runtime unavailable during initial load | Register no Skill, activation bootstrap, or Agent-scoped tools; keep Web Settings available for repair | [`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts), lifecycle tests in [`tests/tools.spec.ts`](../../tests/tools.spec.ts) and [`tests/web.spec.ts`](../../tests/web.spec.ts) |
| Runtime candidate fails during live update | Preserve the current serving generation and stored usable configuration | [`tests/runtime-manager.spec.ts`](../../tests/runtime-manager.spec.ts), [`tests/web.spec.ts`](../../tests/web.spec.ts) |
| Concurrent Settings candidates complete out of order | The newer ticket wins; an obsolete slower candidate cannot activate | [`tests/runtime-manager.spec.ts`](../../tests/runtime-manager.spec.ts) |
| Disable, re-enable, or uninstall | Active plugin-owned calls are cancelled, Agent-scoped tools, bootstrap, and Skill disappear and return as one lifecycle unit, and uninstall removes the bundle layer | [`tests/tools.spec.ts`](../../tests/tools.spec.ts), [`tests/profile-install.e2e.spec.ts`](../../tests/profile-install.e2e.spec.ts) |

## P2 and P3 boundary

| Scope | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| P2 stable `ctx.visionToolkit` service and capability discovery | **Deferred by design** | The product brief requires at least one independent plugin consumer before stabilizing this API. `VisionToolkitRuntime` remains package-internal, so P0/P1 can evolve without creating a false compatibility promise. |
| P2 provider ecosystem | **Deferred by design** | The package supports its pinned upstream and one configured endpoint through OpenAI Chat Completions or Anthropic Messages; it does not prebuild an unused provider registry. |
| P3 exploratory inputs and automation | **Out of scope** | Upload/drag-and-drop, camera/video/audio/document ingestion, interactive annotations, automatic clicking, remote clusters, model routing/voting, and cross-session caches are not part of this release contract. |

## Reproducible verification

Run package checks from `dsh-vision-toolkit/`:

```sh
pnpm run build
pnpm test
pnpm run example:ui-restoration
pnpm pack --dry-run
```

The release acceptance pass additionally runs the repository's plugin checker, installs the package into clean Web and Headless `DSH_HOME` directories, inspects `--dump-config`, exercises local and keyless mock-backed remote tool calls, verifies Settings persistence and live switching, checks dedicated Web cards with zero browser-console errors, disables/re-enables the row, and removes the package. These runtime checks complement the automated tests; they do not replace them.
